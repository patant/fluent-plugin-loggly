    <match your_match>
      type loggly
      loggly_url https://logs-01.loggly.com/inputs/xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx
    </match>
~~~~~
    or if you want to use buffered plugin:
~~~~~
    <match your_match>
      type loggly_buffered
      loggly_url https://logs-01.loggly.com/bulk/xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx
      output_include_time true  # add 'timestamp' record into log. (default: true)
      buffer_type    file
      buffer_path    /path/to/buffer/file
      flush_interval 10s
